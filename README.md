I am excited to share my second task as a Data Science Intern at Prodigy InfoTech. In this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to uncover relationships between variables, identify patterns, and highlight trends within the data using statistical analysis and visualizations.

# 1. Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.

This analysis explores the factors that influenced survival rates among passengers, using data science techniques to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset. We will perform a step-by-step analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, variable relationship analysis, and pattern identification.

The Titanic dataset contains demographic and travel information for passengers, including variables such as:

• Passenger class (Pclass)  
• Sex  
• Age  
• Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)  
• Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)  
• Passenger fare (Fare)  
• Survival status (Survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)  


# 2. Data Acquisition and Preparation

In this step, we acquire the Titanic dataset and prepare it for analysis. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to facilitate machine learning applications, though our focus will be on exploratory analysis.

The dataset contains information about 887 passengers from the Titanic. For analysis purposes, we split the data into:

**• Training set: 709 passengers  
• Test set: 178 passengers**

Here is a sample of the raw data:
